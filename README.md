## What is it?Â 
Introducing EFramework, an open-source development tool designed to democratize the use of AI in the oil and gas industry. Our app serves as a framework to bring together some of the best open-source AI/ML tools in the industry, making them accessible to a wider range of users. With EFramework, there is no need to be a skilled programmer to run open-source ML tools on your own data.We provide easy-to-use code that allows you to input example data (or your own) and compute it, saving the results in each application. This means you can easily explore and experiment with different AI tools, without needing extensive programming knowledge. EFramework is a valuable resource for professionals and researchers in the oil and gas industry, as well as anyone interested in learning more about the potential of AI in this field.
