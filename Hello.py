st.markdown('This app serves as a framework to include some of the best **open-source** O&G AI/ML tools. It democritises the use of AI tools by lifting a need to be a skilled programmer to run open-source ML tools on your own data. \
In most cases, I will include code that allows you to enter the example data (or your own), compute it, and save the results in each application.')
